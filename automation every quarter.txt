Here’s the clean way to automate banks_project.py quarterly on Windows using Task Scheduler.

1) Put your files in a stable folder

Example:

C:\ETL\BanksProject\banks_project.py

(Optional) Create a subfolder for outputs/logs if you want:

*C:\ETL\BanksProject\outputs*

Your script already writes:

Largest_banks_data.csv

Banks.db

code_log.txt

Those will be created in the working directory (important in Step 3).

2) Confirm Python path

Open Command Prompt and run:

where python

Copy the full path you want to use (example):

C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe

3) Create the scheduled task

Open Task Scheduler

Click Create Task… (not “Basic Task”)

General tab

Name: Largest Banks ETL (Quarterly)

Check: Run whether user is logged on or not

Check: Run with highest privileges

Triggers tab → New…

Begin the task: On a schedule

Settings: Monthly

Select Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct

Choose “On:” 1 (runs on the 1st day of those months)

Set a time (example: 09:00 AM)

Enabled ✅

Actions tab → New…

Action: Start a program

Program/script: (your python.exe full path)
Example: C:...\python.exe

Add arguments (important):
"C:\ETL\BanksProject\banks_project.py"

Start in (important):
C:\ETL\BanksProject

Conditions tab

If laptop: you may uncheck “Start the task only if the computer is on AC power” (your choice)

Settings tab

Check: Allow task to be run on demand

Check: Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed

Optionally set: “If the task fails, restart every …”

Click OK, enter your Windows password if prompted.

4) Test it now

Right-click the task → Run
Then check in C:\ETL\BanksProject that you have:

Largest_banks_data.csv

Banks.db

code_log.txt

Also open Task Scheduler → History (or “Last Run Result”) to confirm success.

5) Common Windows gotchas (quick fixes)

Files saved in C:\Windows\System32: you forgot Start in. Set it to your project folder.

Different Python environments: point Program/script to the exact python.exe (or your venv python).

No internet / proxy: the script pulls the webpage + exchange rate CSV online—make sure the machine has access when it runs.
